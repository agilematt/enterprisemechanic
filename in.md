n.A worker skilled in making, using, or repairing machines, vehicles, and tools.

Your enterprise is a machine. A system of systems, perpetually changing. You have indicator lights, but they are intermittently reliable. You want to roll-up your sleeves again but you are in the C-suite now.

What you need is another you. One dedicated to the teams â€“ a hot spot mechanic who can work with any team in the enterprise.

My job is to help you help your teams. I do this by embedding myself into the workflow for a period of time, surfacing problems and working collaboratively with your teams to spotlight solutions.

Together, we bring improvements that stick and results that can be seen in the boardroom.
