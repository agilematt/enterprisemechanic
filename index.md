## Welcome to GitHub Pages

 You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/agilematt/enterprisemechanic/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

 Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

 ### Markdown

 Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

 ```markdown
 Syntax highlighted code block

 [Link](url) and ![Image](src)
 ```

 For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

 ### Jekyll Themes

 Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/agilematt/enterprisemechanic/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

Your enterprise is a machine. A system of systems, perpetually changing. You have indicator lights, but they are intermittently reliable. You want to roll-up your sleeves again but you are in the C-suite now.

What you need is another you. One dedicated to the teams – a hot spot mechanic who can work with any team in the enterprise.

My job is to help you help your teams. I do this by embedding myself into the workflow for a period of time, surfacing problems and working collaboratively with your teams to spotlight solutions.

Together, we bring improvements that stick and results that can be seen in the boardroom.
